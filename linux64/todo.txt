rework audio architecture for vanilla and noaudio so it is simpler to separate
possibly have
- core.c (core program)
- input.c (handles input)
- audio.c (inits the core program and is entrypoint so can handle mallocs so no leak)
- misc.c (stays the same)
and then merge the updater project into the main project.
we keep core.c separate so possibly can prepare for the RUST TUI phase.
audio.c switches from cubeb+dr_flac to something safer like rodeo.
ratatui is used instead of the simple fgets interface.
tokio + json processing library like serde or maybe curl bindings for rust can be used instead of interfacing curl from c.
but keep the core C and GMP because yes.
or if you want simple, just keep everything except for the input.c and audio.c (i fear my audio.c because it had data leaks so have to rework shit)
